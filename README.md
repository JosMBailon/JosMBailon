- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JosMBailon 

Iâ€™m currently learning Python and I'm trying to integrate Py/Tkinter with
AB PLC's (Micro 800 and Control/Compact Logix).
Maybe I can support you with PLC's programs (RSLogix 500, RSLogix 5000, Connected Components Workbench,
Studio 5000, Codesys, TIA Portal or Siemen's Logo).
I know that I'm not an expert but I'll try help you if I can.
